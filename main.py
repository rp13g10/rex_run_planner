"""
Plan:
 Phase 1 - Get something tangible
 * Finish off refactor, clear out archived code once satisfied
 * Improve static plotting utilities
   * Look in to using Folium / dash-leaflet
   * Folium has a ColorLine option which could do this
 * Use plots to validate against Strava
   * Elevation profiles in particular should be very helpful
 * Build out a basic webapp as a PoC
 * Set up function to spit out .gpx files
 
 Phase 2 - Foundations for scalable webapp
 * Look in to options for improving cassandra cluster performance locally,
   suspect memory causing bottleneck at present
 * Check whether there is any way to use partitions with graphframes
 * Swap over to using Docker for pySpark
 * Sort out your requirements files! There should not be missing dependencies
 
 Phase 3 - Set up the data preparation pipeline
  Single k8s stack with all required components
  * Cassandra database
  * pySpark cluster
  * airflow
    * triggers ingestion & processing when new files land
  * custom ingestion script
    https://docs.datastax.com/en/dsbulk/docs/overview/dsbulk-about.html
    Loads data from lidar files into the database
  * custom tagging script
    * triggers tagging of nodes/edges with elevation data once ingestion completes
  * custom parsing script
    osm to networkx, one-off run, arguably could be left out of stack

 Phase 4 - Full build
  * Set up a separate k8s stack for the webapp (or add to existing? check
    suggested design patterns)
  * Move things over to the cloud
